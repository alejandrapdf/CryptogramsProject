hi
be willing to be a beginner every single morning
learn from your failures and start again
never regret anything that made you smile
I would go outside and watch the sunrise
what consumes your mind controls your life
growth begins when we start to accept our own weakness
the light that fills the room feels cold and blue
happy people plan actions they do not plan results
the meaning of life is to give life meaning
the road to success is always under construction
I have never been hurt by what I have not said
never go to a doctor whose office plants have died
either you run the day or the day runs you
the future depends on what you do today
the best time to make friends is before you need them
